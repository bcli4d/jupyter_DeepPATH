# jupyter_DeepPATH
A few scripts to aid running DeepPATH in jupyter.

Clone this repo to a VM which is configured with Cuda, such as the `c2-deeplearning-tf-1-13-cu100-20190314` GCP image,
then execute deeppath_config.sh, and start jupyter:

 `$ git clone https://github.com/bcli4d/jupyter_DeepPATH.git`

 `$ jupyter_DeepPATH/deeppath_config.sh`

 `$ jupyter_DeepPATH/start_jupyter.sh`
